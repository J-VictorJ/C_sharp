            1. Write a C# program that simulates a simple calculator. Ask the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, or /). Use a switch-case statement to perform the calculation and display the result.

            2. Create a C# program that asks the user to enter a month (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.) and then displays the number of days in that month. Use a switch-case statement to handle the different cases for months.

            3. Build a C# program that implements a basic grade calculator. Ask the user to enter a numeric grade (e.g., 85) and use a switch-case statement to convert it into a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on common grading scales.*/
